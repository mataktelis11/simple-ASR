% Sample Rate Convarsion (SRC) demo script


% SUMMARY
%
% This script demonstrates the methods implemented to change the sample rate
% of a 1D signal. More specifically, it is assumed that the signal needs to
% be resampled by a rational factor p/q (where p and q are integers).
%
% Our input signal has a sampling frequency of 441000 Hz. We want to
% reduce this to 8000 Hz. This means the resampled factor is a non integer
% number. There are two known approaches:
%
%      1. Generate an intermediate signal by inserting p âˆ’ 1 zeros between 
%         each of the original samples. Low-pass filter this signal at half
%         of the lower of the two rates. Select every q-th sample from the 
%         filtered output, to obtain the result.
%
%      2. Treat the samples as geometric points and create any needed new
%         points by interpolation. Many interpolation methods can be used.
%
% Method 1 is probably used by Matlab's 'resample' function. A custom
% function is provided (srcLowPassFilter) that implements method 1. It is
% noted that this method is very slow, escpecialy if the length of the
% signal is big. It is likely that Matlab's 'resample' function does some
% optimization.
%
% Method 2 is also implemented in the provided function 'srcInterpolation'.
% It utilizes Matlab's 'interp1' function, and unlike the previous
% function, it is very fast.
%
% 
% This script uses all the above fuctions to resample an audio signal from
% 44.1 kHz to 8 kHz. The commands 'tic' and 'toc' are used to calculate the
% elapsed time foreach function.
